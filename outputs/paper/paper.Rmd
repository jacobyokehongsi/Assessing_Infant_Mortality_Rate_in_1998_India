abstract: "What areas can be improved in order to promote the well-being of women and hence, reduce the infant mortality rate? Utilizing the data from the 1998-1999 India National Family Health Survey provided by the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) program, we look to depict the demographics of Indian women and infant in different states of India. We have found that the root cause of poor infant mortality rates stems from having poor living conditions that affect the likelihood of women to attain education and understand the importance of antenatal care and birth delivery assistance. We also explore other factors such as inheritable traits (unhealthy body weight and anaemia disease) as well as an infant's diet. These factors are crucial in the development of an infant and the reduction of the infant mortality rate. \\par \\textbf{Keywords:} demographics, health, living conditions, infant mortality rate, education, antenatal care, body weight, anaemia, diet."

# Introduction

The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) is a nationwide household survey that provides data for a myriad of evaluation indicators with respect to health, nutrition, population and living standards. A few examples of topics include education, mortality rate and health conditions. In addition to the topics mentioned, each survey also collects comprehensive socio-demographic data including the respondents' age, marital status, residential area, etc. 

The DHS program was established in 1984 and has provided technical assistance to over 300 demographic and health surveys in more than 90 countries. Its main objective is to enhance and develop data collection and utilization by host countries for monitoring and evaluating demographic indicators in order to devise high quality policy development decisions.

In these regards, the DHS program has been majorly successful with the data collected often serving as crucial assistance to the government's policy making to help improve the well-being of the population. Furthermore, the program data is also accessible to health care providers, researchers and post-secondary institutions that have informed research with respect to the public health of the citizens. The program has thus been an invaluable source for quantitative and statistical methods to further understand the demographics of the population holistically. For these aforementioned reasons, the DHS program serves an important and fundamental role within a country's statistical system [@dhs].

The National Family Health Survey (NFHS-2: DHS program in India) on the state findings in India assesses key demographics of women and infant including their education, healthcare and living conditions. These factors are of utmost importance in the growth of a human being. Women that are highly educated tends to pay more attention to their own health leading to a happier and healthier lifestyle. Furthermore, these characteristics of a women would be passed down generations, affecting the health conditions of their infant. 

The NFHS on women and infant's health aims to provide the International Institute for Population Sciences, which is the organization responsible for coordinating the health survey in India, information that includes demographics and trends. With the available data, it would assist the organization to help the Indian government design social policies that will best inform the Indian female and infant population on improving their living standards. Thus, the DHS is one of the key aspects of the foundation in informing Indian women to have a healthy and functional support system as well as ushering new generations of Indians into a prosperous world.

In this paper, we will explore the background and characteristics of Indian women and infant using the data from the 1998-1999 India NFHS-2. Specifically, I will address the following research questions:

- How do various living conditions such as electricity, water and sanitation facilities affect the ability of women to attend school?
- How does education affect women's health and their attention to antenatal care?
- What are the factors that affect infant mortality rate?

The rest of the paper explores the following: Section 2 explores the origin of the data, methods used to obtain the data and its strengths and weaknesses. Section 3 explores the results and the relationships between the variables. Lastly, Section 4 discusses the results as well as potential solutions and policies that could be implemented to improve infant mortality rate.

# Data
## Data Source and Methodology

The data was obtained from India’s second National Family Health Survey (NFHS-2) on women's and infant's health. The survey was conducted in 1998-1999 by the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) using the NFHS questionnaire where households would be interviewed. The questionnaire was devised during workshops held in Mumbai where experts in population and health fields would partake in creating the questions. The target population was a sample of more than 90,000 ever-married women age 15–49 as well as infant born in the three years preceding the survey. The list of villages is used as a sampling frame and first stratified through several variables. Next, the participants were selected using systematic sampling with equal probability from a household list in each village area. The overall individual response rate was 96% with a total of 89,199 eligible women that are part of the 91,196 interviewed households. 

The following is a brief outline of the questionnaire content on the 1998 India NFHS:

- Background characteristics
- Reproductive behavior and intentions
- Quality of care
- Knowledge and use of contraception
- Sources of family planning
- Antenatal, delivery, and postpartum care
- Breastfeeding and health
- Reproductive health
- Status of Women
- Knowledge of AIDS

## Survey Frame and Sampling Method
As mentioned in the previous section, participants of this survey were chosen via stratified sampling and systematic sampling. The survey frame that was created is as follows. The list of villages were first stratified by geographic location, then continuous regions and lastly further stratified using selected variables such as village size, female literacy and so on. Each state in India was stratified individually using these variables with a limit of 6 stratas for small states, 12 stratas for medium size states and 15 stratas for large states. From the list of stratified villages, they are then sampled systematically with probability proportional to the 1991 Census population of the village. The villages that have fewer than five households are not included in the sampling frame. Lastly, the individuals to be interviewed were selected with equal probability from the household list in each village area using systematic sampling.

## Key features
The raw data of the state findings includes 70 variables which were obtained from the questionnaire responses. Key features part of the raw data include education standards, accessibility to electricity, drinking water and toilets, infant mortality rate, mothers receiving antenatal care, anaemia statuses (mothers and infant), weight statuses (mothers and infant) and the infant's diet.

We used R [@citeR] and R packages tidyverse [@tidy] and pdftools [@pdftools] to extract, preprocess and analyze the data. When preprocessing the data, we also used R package pointblank [@pointblank] to put together tests for class and content to ensure that the dataset passes. The key features analyzed in this paper is shown in table 1 and 2, which was made using R package knitr [@knitr].

```{r datafeatures, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data %>%
  select(state, att_school, electricity, infant_mortality) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Several Key Features (in percent)",
    col.names = c("State", "Females Age 6-14 Attending School", "Households with Electricity", "Infant Mortality Rate"),
    digits = 1,
    booktabs = TRUE, 
    linesep = ""
  )
```

```{r datafeatures2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data %>%
  select(state, antenatal, underweight, women_anaemia) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Several Key Features (in percent) Continued.",
    col.names = c("State", "Mothers >= 1 antenatal check-up", "Underweight infant < Age 3", "Women with Anaemia"),
    digits = 1,
    booktabs = TRUE, 
    linesep = ""
  )
```

## Strengths and Weaknesses
### Strengths
The primary strengths of this survey is the myriad of variables describing participants and households, as well as the large sample size where more than 99 percent of India's female population is surveyed. Additionally, all Indian states except for one is surveyed, covering the majority of India. The field data collected by interviewing teams were inputted into microcomputers to produce field-check tables, ensuring that errors are prevented when eliciting information and filling out questionnaires. The large amount of variables allows for thorough data exploration of the relationships between them while the ample amount of data allows concrete conclusions to be drawn. Furthermore, the sampling methodologies is explained in high detail as well as a comprehensive fact sheet put together to display key data from the survey.

### Weaknesses
One of the drawbacks of the survey is that survey findings were obtained in all states but one, that is Tripura, due to the delay in fieldwork based on a local problem. Additionally, data is unable to be obtained from areas with union territories. Nonsampling errors are also present where surveyors were unable to locate and interview the correct household and the misunderstanding of the questionnaire by the interviewer or respondent. In addition, the collection of anaemia data was hindered since some female participants refused to partake in the anaemia testing and/or have their infant tested as well. These aforementioned weaknesses results in missing data thus, the inference we will make could be less diverse.

# Results
The figures were made using R [@citeR], R package tidyverse [@tidy] and Lucidchart [@lucidchart]. The variables explored provides numeric values that varies between the states of India.

```

Figure \@ref(fig:dag) represents a directed acyclic graph that will outline the relationships between the variables explored in the paper. 

## Household conditions that affect females attending school

```{r attsch, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Distribution of the Percent of females age 6-14 attending school in various Indian States"}
# Plot for Percent of females age 6-14 attending school
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(state, att_school), y = att_school, fill = population)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "State",
       y = "Percent of females age 6-14 attending school") + 
  scale_fill_continuous(name = "Population in Millions", type = "viridis") +
  coord_flip()
```

Figure \@ref(fig:attsch) depicts the distribution of females age 6-14 attending school (in percent) across the different states of India. Here, we observe that majority of females attending school, are from states including Kerala, Himachal Pradesh and Goa whereas majority of females not attending school are from Bihar, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. In the states where the majority of females are not attending school, we can infer that these states tend to have a larger population, especially Uttar Pradesh.

```{r elecsch, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Relationship between households with electricity and females attending school (in percent)"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = electricity, y = att_school)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Percent of households with electricity",
       y = "Percent of females age 6-14 attending school") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figure \@ref(fig:elecsch) depicts the relationship between households with electricity and females age 6-14 attending school (in percent). Here, we observe that as the percent of households with electricity increases, the percent of females age 6-14 attending school increases. This implies that households that can afford electricity tend to be more well-off and are able to send their children to school.

```{r watersch, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Relationship between households with drinking water piped or from hand pump and females attending school (in percent)"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = piped_pump_water, y = att_school)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Percent of households with drinking water piped or from hand pump",
       y = "Percent of females age 6-14 attending school") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

```{r waterpop, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Relationship between households with drinking water piped or from hand pump and population in millions (in percent)"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = piped_pump_water, y = population)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Percent of households with drinking water piped or from hand pump",
       y = "Population in Millions (1 July, 2000)") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figure \@ref(fig:watersch) depicts the relationship between households with drinking water piped or from hand pump and females age 6-14 attending school (in percent). Here, we observe that as the percent of households drinking water piped or from hand pump increases, the percent of females age 6-14 attending school decreases at a moderate level which is odd. Therefore, we further analyze this strange trend by investingating the relationship between population and households with drinking water. Looking at Figure \@ref(fig:waterpop), as the percent of households with drinking water piped or from hand pump increases, the population increases. Thus, this aligns with the fact that in Figure \@ref(fig:attsch), states with higher populations are also states where the majority of females are not attending school.

```{r toiletsch, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Relationship between females attending school and households with no toilet/latrine facility (in percent)"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = no_toilet, y = att_school)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Percent of households with no toilet/latrine facility",
       y = "Percent of females age 6-14 attending school") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Lastly, figure \@ref(fig:toiletsch) depicts the relationship between households with no toilet/latrine facility and females age 6-14 attending school (in percent). Here, we observe that as the percent of households with no toilet/latrine facility increases, the percent of females age 6-14 attending school decreases. This implies that households that have sanitation areas contributes to a better living environment leading to educated female individuals in the household.

## Females attending school and Women involved in decisions regarding personal healthcare
```{r schhealth, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Relationship between females attending school and women involved in their own healthcare decisions (in percent)"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = att_school, y = healthcare_decisions)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Percent of females age 6-14 attending school",
       y = "Percent of women involved in their own healthcare decisions") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figure \@ref(fig:schhealth) depicts the relationship between females age 6-14 attending school and women involved in decisions about their own healthcare (in percent). Here, we observe that as the percent of females age 6-14 attending school increases, the percent of women involved in decisions about their own healthcare increases. This suggests that female individuals that are educated are more likely to take care of their own health and live a healthier lifestyle.


## Women involved in decisions regarding personal healthcare and mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up
```{r decante, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Relationship between females attending school mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up (in percent)"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = healthcare_decisions, y = antenatal)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Percent of women involved in their own healthcare decisions",
       y = "% of Mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figure \@ref(fig:decante) depicts the relationship between women involved in their own healthcare decisions and mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up for births in the three years preceding the survey (in percent). Here, we observe that as the percent of women involved in own healthcare decisions increases, the percent of mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up for births increases. This suggests that female individuals who are informed of their personal health care are also wary of having antenatal check-up conducted.

## Mothers that receive antenatal check-up and the antenatal care they receive
Here, we explore how mothers that have antenatal check-up affect the antenatal care they receive for births three years preceding the survey.

### Antenatal Injections and Supplements

```{r anteiron, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Relationship between folic acid tablets or syrup and mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up and mothers receiving iron  (in percent)"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = antenatal, y = iron_folic)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up",
       y = "Mothers receiving iron and folic acid tablets or syrup") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

```{r anteinject, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Relationship between mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up and mothers receiving two or more tetanus toxoid injections  (in percent)"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = antenatal, y = injections)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up",
       y = "Mothers receiving two or more tetanus toxoid injections") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figures \@ref(fig:anteiron) and \@ref(fig:anteinject) depict the relationships between mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up with mothers receiving iron and folic acid tablets or syrup as well as two or more tetanus toxoid injections (in percent) respectively. We observe that as the percent of mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up increases, the percent of mothers receiving two or more tetanus toxoid injections as well as iron and folic acid tablets or syrup increases. This suggests that as mothers attend antenatal check-ups, doctors are likely to prescribe the mothers with tetanus toxoid injections as well as iron and folic acid supplements which boosts the health of the mother for a good birth delivery.

### Birth Delivery
```{r antemed, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Relationship between mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up and deliveries in medical institutions (in percent)"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = antenatal, y = deli_med_inst)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up",
       y = "Deliveries in medical institutions") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

```{r antehealth, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Relationship between mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up and deliveries assisted by a health professional (in percent)"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = antenatal, y = deli_health_pro)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up",
       y = "Deliveries assisted by a health professional") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figures \@ref(fig:antemed) and \@ref(fig:antehealth) depict the relationships between mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up with deliveries in medical institutions as well as deliveries assisted by a health professional (in percent) respectively. We observe that as the percent of mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up increases, the percent of deliveries in medical institutions as well as deliveries assisted by a health professional increases. This suggests that when mothers go for their antenatal check-up, they likely have to approach a medical institution and have their check-up conducted by a health professional.

## Factors that affect Infant Mortality Rate

In this subsection, we will explore the factors that will affect the infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births for the five years preceding the survey.

```{r statemortal, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Distribution of Infant Mortality Rate in various Indian States"}
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(state, infant_mortality), y = infant_mortality, fill = state)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "State",
       y = "Infant Mortality Rate") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  coord_flip()
```

Figure \@ref(fig:statemortal) depicts the distribution of infant mortality rate across the different states of India. Here, we observe that states with the highest infant mortality rates include Meghalaya, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh whereas states with the lowest infant mortality rates include Kerala, Himachal Pradesh and Goa.

### Health Profile and Delivery Methods of Mothers prior to giving birth
Here, we explore how different health profile factors and delivery methods affect the infant mortality rate for births in the three years preceding the survey.

```{r ironmortal, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Relationship between mothers receiving iron and folic acid tablets or syrup and infant mortality rate (in percent)"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = iron_folic, y = infant_mortality)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Mothers receiving iron and folic acid tablets or syrup",
       y = "Infant Mortality Rate") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

```{r injectmortal, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Relationship between mothers receiving two or more tetanus toxoid injections and infant mortality rate (in percent)"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = injections, y = infant_mortality)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Mothers receiving two or more tetanus toxoid injections",
       y = "Infant Mortality Rate") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figures \@ref(fig:ironmortal) and \@ref(fig:injectmortal) depicts the relationship between mothers receiving iron and folic acid tablets or syrup, and two or more tetanus toxoid injections (in percent) with infant mortality rate respectively. Here, we observe that as the percent of mothers receiving iron and folic acid tablets or syrup and two or more tetanus toxoid injections increases, the infant mortality rate decreases. This suggests that mothers that pay more attention to their own health and maintain a healthy regimen will lead to a reduction in deaths of infants when they are born.

```{r medmortal, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Relationship between deliveries in medical institutions and infant mortality rate (in percent)"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = deli_med_inst, y = infant_mortality)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Deliveries in medical institutions",
       y = "Infant Mortality Rate") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

```{r promortal, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Relationship between deliveries assisted by a health professional and infant mortality rate(in percent)"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = deli_health_pro, y = infant_mortality)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Deliveries assisted by a health professional",
       y = "Infant Mortality Rate") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figures \@ref(fig:medmortal) and \@ref(fig:promortal) depicts the relationship between deliveries in medical institutions and deliveries assisted by a health professional (in percent) with the infant mortality rate respectively. Here, we observe that as the percent of deliveries in medical institutions and deliveries assisted by a health professional increases, the infant mortality rate decreases. This implies that mothers that receive proper care during birth deliveries will also have a smooth child birth.

## infant that receive breastmilk and/or both breastmilk and solid food

```{r breastmortal, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Relationship between infant age 0-3 months exclusively breastfed and infant mortality rate (in percent)"}
data %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = breastfed, y = infant_mortality)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Percent of infant age 0-3 months exclusively breastfed",
       y = "Infant Mortality Rate") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

```{r breastfoodmortal, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Relationship between infant age 6-9 months receiving breast milk and solid/mushy food  and infant mortality rate (in percent)"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = child_milkfood, y = infant_mortality)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Percent of infant age 6-9 months receiving breast milk and solid/mushy food",
       y = "Infant Mortality Rate") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figures \@ref(fig:breastmortal) and \@ref(fig:breastfoodmortal) portrays the relationship between infant age 0-3 months exclusively breastfed, and infant age 6-9 months receiving breast milk and solid/mushy food (in percent) with the infant mortality rate respectively. Here, we observe that the percent of infant age 0-3 months that are exclusively breastfed does not have a significant impact on infant mortality rate. On the other hand, as the percent of infant age 6-9 months receiving breast milk and solid/mushy food increases, the infant mortality rate decreases. This indicates that regardless of breast milk or formula milk fed to infant at age 0-3 months, infant mortality rate is not affected. However, as infant grow to the age of 6-9 months, they should be provided solid/mushy food on top of breast milk to support their growth, reducing their mortality.

## Relationship between a women's body mass index (BMI), child's weight and infant mortality rate

```{r bmiunder, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Relationship between women with BMI below 18.5 kg/m  and infant under age three that are underweight (in percent)"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = below_BMI, y = underweight)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Percent of women with BMI below 18.5 kg/m",
       y = "Percent of infant under age three that are underweight") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figure \@ref(fig:bmiunder) depicts the relationship between women with BMI below 18.5 kg/m and infant under age three years that are underweight (in percent). Here, we observe that as the percent of women with BMI below 18.5 kg/m increases, the percent of infant under age three years that are underweight increases. This implies that mothers that are skinny and malnutritioned would also lead to offsprings that are underweight.

```{r undermortal, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Relationship between infant under age three years that are underweight and infant mortality rate (in percent)"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = underweight, y = infant_mortality)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Percent of infant under age three years that are underweight",
       y = "Infant Mortality Rate") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figure \@ref(fig:undermortal) depicts the relationship between infant under age three years that are underweight (in percent) and infant mortality rate. Here, we observe that as the percent of infant under age three that are underweight increases, the infant mortality rate increases. From this we can infer that infant who are not underweight tends to be in good health which reduces infant mortality rate.

## Relationship between women with anaemia, infant with anaemia and infant mortality rate

```{r womenchildanaem, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Relationship between women age 15–49 with any anaemia and infant age 6–35 months with any anaemia (in percent)"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = women_anaemia, y = child_anaemia)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Percent of women age 15–49 with any anaemia",
       y = "Percent of infant age 6–35 months with any anaemia") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figure \@ref(fig:womenchildanaem) depicts the relationship between women age 15-49 with any anaemia and infant age 6-35 months with any anaemia (in percent). Here, we observe that as the percent of women age 15-49 with any anaemia increases, the percent of infant age 6-35 months with any anaemia increases. This is coherent with the fact that since anaemia such as hemolytic anaemia can be inherited, mothers could pass on the anaemia to their offspring.

```{r childmortal, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Relationship between infant age 6–35 months with any anaemia and infant mortality rate (in percent)"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = child_anaemia, y = infant_mortality)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Percent of infant age 6–35 months with any anaemia",
       y = "Infant Mortality Rate") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figure \@ref(fig:childmortal) depicts the infant age 6–35 months with any anaemia (in percent) and infant mortality rate. Here, we observe that as the percent of infant age 6–35 months with any anaemia increases, the infant mortality rate increases. From this we can infer that infant who have the anaemia disease would have symptoms that lead to critical health conditions and death.

# Discussion
The ultimate goal of the paper is to assist policy makers in implementing appropriate and efficient socio-economic policies to help promote the growth of infant and reduce infant mortality rate in India. We will first discuss the root of the issue which is the household living environment, women's education and their healthcare decisions which lead them to attend antenatal check-ups. Then, we examine the numerous factors that is affected by conducting antenatal check-ups which include antenatal supplements and birth delivery methods. These factors are one of the few that directly impact the infant mortality rate. Additionally, we also look at the importance of infant's meals in their growth. Lastly, we examine inheritable traits such as anaemia and body weight that could be passed on from mother to child and how they impact the infant mortality rate. The full data can be found in Appendix B.

## Household Living Environment, Women's Education and their Healthcare Decisions 
The household living environment of individuals including access to electricity, clean water and sanitation facilities is crucial in providing a comfortable and productive living space. As observed previously, households with better living conditions will also lead to women who are able to attend school and be well educated. In our figures, we could infer that households in India with poorer living conditions also have fewer women attending school. Thus, emphasis should be put in developing the living conditions within households in India, especially states with poorer living conditions such as Bihar. In Bihar, only 18.2% of the households have access to electricity and 54.1% of females attending school. With such poor basic needs and living standards, there is no doubt that the women is unable to attend school. By developing the living conditions, it will in turn improve the well-being of the population and encourage women to attend school. Another proposal could also be to provide direct subsidies for students in hopes to attain a well educated population. 

Having an educated female population, we observe that women are more involved in making decisions regarding their own health care. By paying a higher attention to their personal health, women would devote more time and effort in ensuring a healthy lifestyle. In more developed states such as Himachal Pradesh, 97.3% of females age 6-14 are attending school. As these females become mothers, their personal knowledge on healthcare would be carried forward to having antenatal care which is shown as 80.8% of women is involved in decisions about their own health care in Himachal Pradesh. 

## Antenatal check-ups, injections and supplements to promote mothers and infant health
Attending antenatal check-ups is key for protecting the health of women and their unborn infant. During antenatal check-ups, it is likely that doctors prescribe supplements and procedures needed in order for a smooth child birth. This includes iron and folic acid supplements that supports the development of the placenta and fetus as well as enabling the red blood cells in the body to supply oxygen to the child [@ironfolic], and tetanus toxoid injections to prevent neonatal tetanus [@tetanus]. Furthermore, partaking in check-ups will also increase the likelihood of having child deliveries in medical institutions and/or by a health professional since the check-ups are conducted in a similar fashion. Child deliveries in this manner are safe and sanitary, ensuring that the baby is delivered without any infections or accidents. In our data, we observe that in states where mothers often receive at least one antenatal check-up such as Goa (99.0% of mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up), they also pay more attention to antenatal care where mothers receive two or more tetanus toxoid injections (86.1%), iron and folic acid tablets or syrups (94.7%) as well as having their infant delivered in medical institutions (90.8%) and/or by a health professional (90.8%). 

## Meals of infants and their effects on infant mortality rate
The diet of an infant is one of the most important fundamentals in a child's health. An infant has to be well-fed in order to receive the nutrients and vitamins required for a healthy body. To recap, we observe that for infant age 0-3 months, being exclusively breastfed does not have a significant impact on the infant mortality rate. On the other hand, for infant age 6-9 months, it is important that they receive solid/mushy food to supplement the breast milk they are consuming. States such as Rajasthan with low percent of infant age 6-9 months receiving breast milk and solid/mushy food (17.5%) also have high infant mortality rates (80.4%). As a child grows, the nutrients supplied by the breast milk is simply insufficient to develop a healthy immune system. Thus, it is vital that infant are supplied with ample amount of nutritious solid foods on top of breast/formula milk to promote a healthy growth.

## Body weight and anaemia of mothers affecting infant and the infant mortality rate
Lastly, we will explore how inheritable traits that mothers possess such as body weight and diseases (anaemia) are inherited by their infant and would be detrimental to their health. In our data exploration, women that have BMI below 18.5kg/m is considered to be underweight [@bmi]. Hence, women that are underweight would increase the likelihood of their offsprings being underweight and malnourished. Without a strong functional health system, the child would be weak and frail resulting in a higher rate of infant deaths.

On the other hand, infant could also inherit anaemia diseases from their mother. Anaemia is a condition in which the body does not have sufficient healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen around the body. Symptoms of anaemia include tiredness, shortness of breath, irregular heartbeats and more [@anaemia]. As infant are born with this disease, they are fatigued and sick leading to their poor health and death. In the northeast state of Assam, the percent of women age 15-49 with any anaemia is approximately 69.7% which also corresponds to the high anaemia rates of 63.2% in infant age 6-35 months. The percentage of infant with anaemia is relatively close to the percentage of women with anaemia. From this, we can infer that infant are most likely to have inherited this disease from their mother.

## Weaknesses and next steps

There are a few weaknesses in the paper that I will evaluate. Firstly, the data is not collected by myself and hence, we only know as much about the methodology behind it as we've been provided. Despite this being a potentially major issue, the IIPS did more than their due diligence by providing supple information in explaining every aspects of the survey including the survey methodology and sampling techniques as well as documenting detailed variable names. However, there could be potential biases that is unaccounted for by the IIPS that includes the sampling or surveying process and ethical considerations that impacts the data collection in which we have no information about them.

Another possible weakness in our paper is the uncertainty in which the factors are individually correlated to the infant mortality rate. For instance, infant that do not receive solid/mushy food is not the sole reason for the deaths in the infant. Instead, it is the amalgamation of all the different factors analysed that leads to the deaths of infants. As a next step for this issue, we could conduct statistical tests such as t-tests to determine if individual variables are statistically significant when regressed on the infant mortality rate. Apart from the aforementioned variables, there are factors such as the household income, family size etc. that could affect a child's ability of attending school. Hence, by collecting more data on more variables, we would be able to make even more concrete conclusions with regards to the factors that contribute to infant mortality.

To summarise, there are numerous factors that could affect infant mortality rate which includes the weight of a child, whether a child has anaemia, diet of the child and the prenatal health of the mother. The health of the mother stems from the education she undertook and the living conditions she grew up in. Hence, it is crucial for the government to develop policies that solves the problem at its root by first improving the living standards of households, starting with states such as Bihar with the poorest living conditions. The government could also build more schools as well as subsidize education expenses for families which encourages them to send their infant to school. Having adequate to good living conditions and educated women would improve the health of the mother and her offspring, resulting in a healthier future generation of India.
