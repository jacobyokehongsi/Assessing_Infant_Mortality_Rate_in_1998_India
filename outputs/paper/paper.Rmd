# Introduction

The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) is a nationwide household survey that provides data for a myriad of evaluation indicators with respect to health, nutrition and population. A few examples of topics include education, mortality rate and health conditions. In addition to the topics mentioned, each survey also collects comprehensive socio-demographic data including the respondents' age, marital status, residential area, etc. 

The DHS program was established in 1984 and has provided technical assistance to over 300 demographic and health surveys in more than 90 countries with its main objective to enhance and develop data collection and utilization by host countries for monitoring and evaluating demographic indicators in order to devise high quality policy development decisions.

In these regards, the DHS program has been majorly successful with the data collected often serving as crucial assistance to the government's policy making to help improve the well-being of the population. Furthermore, the program data is also accessible to health care providers, researchers and post-secondary institutions that have informed research with respect to the public health of the citizens. The program has thus been an invaluable source for quantitative and statistical methods to further understand the demographics of the population holistically. For these aforementioned reasons, the DHS program serves an important and fundamental role within a country's statistical system. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_and_Health_Surveys)

The National Family Health Survey (DHS program in India) on the state findings in India assesses key demographics of women and children including their education, healthcare and living conditions. These factors are of utmost importance in the growth of a human being. Women that are highly educated tends to pay more attention to their own health leading to a happier and healthier lifestyle. Furthermore, these characteristics of a women would be passed down generations, affecting the health conditions of their children. 

The DHS on women and children's health aims to provide the International Institute for Population Sciences, which is the organization responsible for coordinating the health survey in India, information that includes demographics and trends. With the available data, it would assist the organization to help the Indian government design social policies that will best inform the Indian female and children population on improving their living standards. Thus, the DHS is one of the key aspects of the foundation in informing Indian women to have a healthy and functional support system as well as ushering new generations of Indians into a prosperous world.

In this paper, we will explore the background and characteristics of Indian women and children using the data from the 1998-1999 India NFHS-2. Specifically, I will address the following research questions:

# Data
## Data Source and Methodology

The data was obtained from India’s second National Family Health Survey (NFHS-2) on women's and children's health. The survey was conducted in 1998-1999 using the NFHS questionnaire where households would be interviewed. The questionnaire was devised during workshops held in Mumbai where experts in population and health fields would partake in creating the questions. The target population was a sample of more than 90,000 ever-married women age 15–49 as well as children born in the three years preceding the survey. The list of villages is used as a sampling frame and first stratified through several variables. Next, the participants were selected using systematic sampling with equal probability from a household list in each village area. The overall individual response rate was 96% with a total of 89,199 eligible women that are part of the 91,196 interviewed households. 

The following is a brief outline of the questionnaire content on the 1998 India NFHS:

- Background characteristics
- Reproductive behavior and intentions
- Quality of care
- Knowledge and use of contraception
- Sources of family planning
- Antenatal, delivery, and postpartum care
- Breastfeeding and health
- Reproductive health
- Status of Women
- Knowledge of AIDS

## Survey Frame and Sampling Method
As mentioned in the previous section, participants of this survey were chosen via stratified sampling and systematic sampling. The survey frame that was created is as follows. The list of villages were first stratified by geographic location, then continuous regions and lastly further stratified using selected variables such as village size, female literacy and so on. Each state in India was stratified individually using these variables with a limit of 6 stratas for small states, 12 stratas for medium size states and 15 stratas for large states. From the list of stratified villages, they are then sampled systematically with probability proportional to the 1991 Census population of the village. The villages that have fewer than five households are not included in the sampling frame. Lastly, the individuals to be interviewed were selected with equal probability from the household list in each village area using systematic sampling.

## Key features
The raw data of the state findings includes 70 variables which were obtained from the questionnaire responses. Key features part of the raw data include education standards, accessibility to electricity and toilets, infant mortality rate, mothers receiving antenatal care, vaccination status of children, anaemia statuses (mothers and children) and weight statuses (mothers and children).

We used R (R Core Team 2020) and R package tidyverse (Wickham et al. 2019) to preprocess and analyze the data. When preprocessing the data, we also use R package pointblank (cite) to put together tests for class and content to ensure that the dataset passes. The key features analyzed in this paper is shown in table 1, which was made using R package knitr (cite).


```{r datafeatures, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data %>%
  select(state, att_school, electricity, infant_mortality) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Several Key Features Analyzed in the Paper",
    col.names = c("State", "Females Age 6-14 Attending School", "Households with Electricity", "Infant Mortality Rate"),
    digits = 1,
    booktabs = TRUE, 
    linesep = ""
  )
```

```{r datafeatures2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data %>%
  select(state, underweight, women_anaemia) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Several Key Features Analyzed in the Paper Continued.",
    col.names = c("State", "Children under Age Three that are Underweight", "Women Age 15-49 with any Anaemia"),
    digits = 1,
    booktabs = TRUE, 
    linesep = ""
  )
```

## Strengths and Weaknesses
### Strengths
The primary strengths of this survey is the myriad of variables describing participants and households, as well as the large sample size where more than 99 percent of India's female population is surveyed. Additionally, all Indian states except for one is surveyed, covering the majority of India. The field data collected by interviewing teams were inputted into microcomputers to produce field-check tables, ensuring that errors are prevented when eliciting information and filling out questionnaires. The large amount of variables allows for thorough data exploration of the relationships between them while the ample amount of data allows concrete conclusions to be drawn. Furthermore, the sampling methodologies is explained in high detail as well as a comprehensive fact sheet put together to display key data from the survey.

### Weaknesses
One of the drawbacks of the survey is that survey findings were obtained in all states but one, that is Tripura, due to the delay in fieldwork based on a local problem. Additionally, data is unable to be obtained from areas with union territories. Nonsampling errors are also present where surveyors were unable to locate and interview the correct household and the misunderstanding of the questionnaire by the interviewer or respondent. In addition, the collection of anaemia data was hindered since some female participants refused to partake in the anaemia testing and/or have their children tested as well. These aforementioned weaknesses results in missing data thus, the inference we make could be less diverse.

## Household conditions that affect females attending school

```{r attsch, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Distribution of the Percent of females age 6-14 attending school in various Indian States"}
# Plot for Percent of females age 6-14 attending school
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(state, att_school), y = att_school, fill = population)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "State",
       y = "Percent of females age 6-14 attending school") + 
  scale_fill_continuous(name = "Population in Millions", type = "viridis") +
  coord_flip()
```

Figure \@ref(fig:attsch) depicts the distribution of females age 6-14 attending school (in percent) across the different states of India. Here, we observe that majority of females attending school, are from states including Kerala, Himachal Pradesh and Goa whereas majority of females not attending school are from Bihar, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. In the states where the majority of females are not attending school, we can infer that these states tend to have a larger population, especially Uttar Pradesh.

```{r elecsch, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Relationship between females age 6-14 attending school and Percent of households with electricity (in percent)"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = electricity, y = att_school)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Percent of households with electricity",
       y = "Percent of females age 6-14 attending school") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figure \@ref(fig:elecsch) depicts the relationship between households with electricity and females age 6-14 attending school (in percent). Here, we observe that as the percent of households with electricity increases, the percent of females age 6-14 attending school increases. This implies that households that can afford electricity tend to be more well-off and are able to send their children to school.

```{r watersch, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Graph of Illiteracy vs Immunization Rate"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = piped_pump_water, y = att_school)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Percent of households with drinking water piped or from hand pump",
       y = "Percent of females age 6-14 attending school") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

```{r waterpop, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Graph of Illiteracy vs Immunization Rate"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = piped_pump_water, y = population)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Percent of households with drinking water piped or from hand pump",
       y = "Population in Millions (1 July, 2000)") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figure \@ref(fig:watersch) depicts the relationship between households with drinking water piped or from hand pump and females age 6-14 attending school (in percent). Here, we observe that as the percent of households drinking water piped or from hand pump increases, the percent of females age 6-14 attending school decreases at a moderate level. If we were to also look at Figure \@ref(fig:waterpop), as the percent of households with drinking water piped or from hand pump increases, the population increases. Thus, this aligns with the fact that in Figure \@ref(fig:attsch), states with higher populations are also states where the majority of females are not attending school.

```{r toiletsch, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Graph of Illiteracy vs Immunization Rate"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = no_toilet, y = att_school)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Percent of households with no toilet/latrine facility",
       y = "Percent of females age 6-14 attending school") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Lastly, figure \@ref(fig:toiletsch) depicts the relationship between households with no toilet/latrine facility and females age 6-14 attending school (in percent). Here, we observe that as the percent of households with no toilet/latrine facility increases, the percent of females age 6-14 attending school decreases This implies that households that have sanitation areas contributes to a better living environment leading to educated female individuals in the household.

## Females attending school and Women involved in decisions regarding personal healthcare
```{r schhealth, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Graph of Illiteracy vs Immunization Rate"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = att_school, y = healthcare_decisions)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Percent of females age 6-14 attending school",
       y = "Percent of women involved in their own healthcare decisions") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figure \@ref(fig:schhealth) depicts the relationship between females age 6-14 attending school and women involved in decisions about their own healthcare (in percent). Here, we observe that as the percent of females age 6-14 attending school increases, the percent of women involved in decisions about their own healthcare increases. This suggests that female individuals that are educated are more likely to take care of their own health and live a healthier lifestyle.


## Women involved in decisions regarding personal healthcare and mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up
```{r decante, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Graph of Illiteracy vs Immunization Rate"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = healthcare_decisions, y = antenatal)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Percent of women involved in their own healthcare decisions",
       y = "Mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figure \@ref(fig:decante) depicts the relationship between women involved in their own healthcare decisions and mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up for births in the three years preceding the survey (in percent). Here, we observe that as the percent of women involved in own healthcare decisions increases, the percent of mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up for births increases. This suggests that female individuals who are informed of their personal health care are also wary of having antenatal check-up conducted.

## Mothers that receive antenatal check-up and the antenatal care they receive
Here, we explore how mothers that have antenatal check-up affect the antenatal care they receive for births three years preceding the survey.

### Antenatal Injections and Supplements

```{r anteiron, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Graph of Illiteracy vs Immunization Rate"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = antenatal, y = iron_folic)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up",
       y = "Mothers receiving iron and folic acid tablets or syrup") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

```{r anteinject, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Graph of Illiteracy vs Immunization Rate"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = antenatal, y = injections)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up",
       y = "Mothers receiving two or more tetanus toxoid injections") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figures \@ref(fig:anteiron) and \@ref(fig:anteinject) depict the relationships between mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up with mothers receiving iron and folic acid tablets or syrup as well as two or more tetanus toxoid injections (in percent) respectively. We observe that as the percent of mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up increases, the percent of mothers receiving two or more tetanus toxoid injections as well as iron and folic acid tablets or syrup increases. This suggests that as mothers attend antenatal check-ups, doctors are likely to prescribe the mothers with tetanus toxoid injections as well as iron and folic acid supplements which boosts the health of the mother for a good birth delivery.

### Birth Delivery
```{r antemed, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Graph of Illiteracy vs Immunization Rate"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = antenatal, y = deli_med_inst)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up",
       y = "Deliveries in medical institutions") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

```{r antehealth, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Graph of Illiteracy vs Immunization Rate"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = antenatal, y = deli_health_pro)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up",
       y = "Deliveries assisted by a health professional") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figures \@ref(fig:antemed) and \@ref(fig:antehealth) depict the relationships between mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up with deliveries in medical institutions as well as deliveries assisted by a health professional (in percent) respectively. We observe that as the percent of mothers receiving at least one antenatal check-up increases, the percent of deliveries in medical institutions as well as deliveries assisted by a health professional increases. This suggests that when mothers go for their antenatal check-up, they likely have to approach a medical institution and have their check-up conducted by a health professional.

## Factors that affect Infant Mortality Rate

In this subsection, we will explore the factors that will affect the infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births for the five years preceding the survey.

```{r statemortal, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Distribution of Infant Mortality Rate in various Indian States"}
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(state, infant_mortality), y = infant_mortality, fill = state)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "State",
       y = "Infant Mortality Rate") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  coord_flip()
```

Figure \@ref(fig:statemortal) depicts the distribution of infant mortality rate across the different states of India. Here, we observe that states with the highest infant mortality rates include Meghalaya, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh whereas states with the lowest infant mortality rates include Kerala, Himachal Pradesh and Goa.

### Health Profile and Delivery Methods of Mothers prior to giving birth
Here, we explore how different health profile factors and delivery methods affect the infant mortality rate for births in the three years preceding the survey.

```{r ironmortal, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Graph of Illiteracy vs Immunization Rate"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = iron_folic, y = infant_mortality)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Mothers receiving iron and folic acid tablets or syrup",
       y = "Infant Mortality Rate") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

```{r injectmortal, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Graph of Illiteracy vs Immunization Rate"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = injections, y = infant_mortality)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Mothers receiving two or more tetanus toxoid injections",
       y = "Infant Mortality Rate") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figures \@ref(fig:ironmortal) and \@ref(fig:injectmortal) depicts the relationship between mothers receiving iron and folic acid tablets or syrup, and two or more tetanus toxoid injections (in percent) with infant mortality rate respectively. Here, we observe that as the percent of mothers receiving iron and folic acid tablets or syrup and two or more tetanus toxoid injections increases, the infant mortality rate decreases. This suggests that mothers that pay more attention to their own health and maintain a healthy regimen will lead to a reduction in deaths of infants when they are born.

```{r medmortal, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Graph of Illiteracy vs Immunization Rate"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = deli_med_inst, y = infant_mortality)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Deliveries in medical institutions",
       y = "Infant Mortality Rate") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

```{r promortal, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Graph of Illiteracy vs Immunization Rate"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = deli_health_pro, y = infant_mortality)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Deliveries assisted by a health professional",
       y = "Infant Mortality Rate") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figures \@ref(fig:medmortal) and \@ref(fig:promortal) depicts the relationship between deliveries in medical institutions and deliveries assisted by a health professional (in percent) with the infant mortality rate respectively. Here, we observe that as the percent of deliveries in medical institutions and deliveries assisted by a health professional increases, the infant mortality rate decreases. This implies that mothers that receive proper care during birth deliveries will also have a smooth child birth.

## Children that receive breastmilk and/or both breastmilk and solid food

```{r breastmortal, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Graph of Illiteracy vs Immunization Rate"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = breastfed, y = infant_mortality)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Percent of children age 0-3 months exclusively breastfed",
       y = "Infant Mortality Rate") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

```{r breastfoodmortal, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Graph of Illiteracy vs Immunization Rate"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = child_milkfood, y = infant_mortality)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Percent of children age 6-9 months receiving breast milk and solid/mushy food",
       y = "Infant Mortality Rate") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figures \@ref(fig:breastmortal) and \@ref(fig:breastfoodmortal) portrays the relationship between children age 0-3 months exclusively breastfed, and children age 6-9 months receiving breast milk and solid/mushy food (in percent) with the infant mortality rate respectively. Here, we observe that the percent of children age 0-3 months that are exclusively breastfed does not have a significant impact on infant mortality rate. On the other hand, as the percent of children age 6-9 months receiving breast milk and solid/mushy food increases, the infant mortality rate decreases. This indicates that regardless of breast milk or formula milk fed to children at age 0-3 months, infant mortality rate is not affected. However, as children grow to the age of 6-9 months, they should be provided solid/mushy food on top of breast milk to support their growth, reducing their mortality.

## Relationship between a women's body mass index (BMI), child's weight and infant mortality rate

```{r bmiunder, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Graph of Illiteracy vs Immunization Rate"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = below_BMI, y = underweight)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Percent of women with BMI below 18.5 kg/m",
       y = "Percent of children under age three that are underweight") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figure \@ref(fig:bmiunder) depicts the relationship between women with BMI below 18.5 kg/m and children under age three years that are underweight (in percent). Here, we observe that as the percent of women with BMI below 18.5 kg/m increases, the percent of children under age three years that are underweight increases. This implies that mothers that are skinny and malnutritioned would also lead to offsprings that are underweight.

```{r undermortal, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Graph of Illiteracy vs Immunization Rate"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = underweight, y = infant_mortality)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Percent of children under age three years that are underweight",
       y = "Infant Mortality Rate") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figure \@ref(fig:undermortal) depicts the relationship between children under age three years that are underweight (in percent) and infant mortality rate. Here, we observe that as the percent of children under age three that are underweight increases, the infant mortality rate increases. From this we can infer that children who are not underweight tends to be in good health which reduces infant mortality rate.

## Relationship between women with anaemia, children with anaemia and infant mortality rate

```{r womenchildanaem, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Graph of Illiteracy vs Immunization Rate"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = women_anaemia, y = child_anaemia)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Percent of women age 15–49 with any anaemia",
       y = "Percent of children age 6–35 months with any anaemia") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figure \@ref(fig:womenchildanaem) depicts the relationship between women age 15-49 with any anaemia and children age 6-35 months with any anaemia (in percent). Here, we observe that as the percent of women age 15-49 with any anaemia increases, the percent of children age 6-35 months with any anaemia increases. This is coherent with the fact that since anaemia such as hemolytic anaemia can be inherited, mothers could pass on the anaemia to their offspring.

```{r childmortal, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Graph of Illiteracy vs Immunization Rate"}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = child_anaemia, y = infant_mortality)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Percent of children age 6–35 months with any anaemia",
       y = "Infant Mortality Rate") + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

Figure \@ref(fig:childmortal) depicts the children age 6–35 months with any anaemia (in percent) and infant mortality rate. Here, we observe that as the percent of children age 6–35 months with any anaemia increases, the infant mortality rate increases. From this we can infer that children who have the anaemia disease would have symptoms that lead to critical health conditions and death.
